            February 28th - Pekol Spotted in Toronto at Dundas and Jarvis
        </div>
        <div class="newsText">
            Pekol was tracked by our EAPAE team to a hideout at Dundas and Jarvis, in Toronto Canada. He quickly disappeared with some super natural speed, but based on past experience we know he must not have gotten far. The hunt continues.
