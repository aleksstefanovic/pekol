            James K. Peckol's early life is not well known. We know that Doctor Peckol earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Univsersity of Washington in 1985. After which, he continued to teach at the institution. He became particularly well known for his classes on the C# programming language, specifically his online courses. His students often spoke of him as a calm well-mannered man, who occasionally would make a variety of nerdy coding jokes in class. It appears that his most common joke, was that he would “break your fingers” if one did any sort of bad programming that was not considered “best practice”. This was a joke made light-heartedly, albeit a little dark, that students did not take seriously. One tragic day, a student working on an exercise suggested by Doctor Peckol performed a most vicious violation of coding best practice, and was soon reprimanded. The man spoke little of the event when we interviewed him a few years back, clearly the trauma goes very deep, but it was not hard to piece out what happened. In a span of a fews seconds after typing the code, the student’s poor fingers were all broken. Nothing but a shadow swept through room, as quick as lightning. Peckol was never seen in public again. Peckol was on the loose, on a mindless code fixing rampage.

            There were a number of Peckol attacks in the years following the doctor’s fall into madness. The media made a strong attempt to cover them up, to prevent mass international panic. With the number of Peckol attacks increasing each year and the government refusing to do anything about it, we were forced to do the only thing we could. The Peckol Prevention Project (PPP) was born, a union of the best in coding, self-defence, and conspiracy theorists to combat this threat. We currently have over 250 undercover operatives across the world, actively working to find Peckol, prevent Peckol, and if necessary, stop Peckol. But like any hazard, knowledge is survival. We’ve interviewed countless victims and investigated hundreds of attacks, to bring you the best most up to date survival tips and strategies on the Doctor Peckol phenomenon.

           The PPP is dedicated to ending the Peckol threat. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t following coding best practices! It's a really good thing to do, Peckol or no Peckol. Seriously though, you shouldn’t have your fingers broken if you don’t follow best practice sometimes. Hence, Peckol must be detained, or removed if he will not cooperate. Currently our EAPAE (Elite Anti Peckol Assault & Eradication) team has tracked Peckol to the Toronto area of Ontario Canada. We believe it will not be long before we close in on his position. These are specially trained soldiers, with the highest level of skill in medium to long range weapon tactics as well ASP.NET and C#; they will not fail.
