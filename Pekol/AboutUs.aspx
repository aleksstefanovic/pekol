            NAME Pekol's early life is not well known. We know that Doctor Pekol earned his University Degree in Computer Science from UNIVERSITY OF PLACE in DATE. After which, he continued to teach at the institution. He became particularly well known for his classes on the C# programming language, specifically his online courses. His students often spoke of him as a calm well-mannered man, who occasionally would make a variety of nerdy coding jokes in class. It appears that his most common joke, was that he would “break your fingers” if one did any sort of bad programming that was not considered “best practice”. This was a joke made light-heartedly, albeit a little dark, that not students took seriously. One tragic day, a student working on an exercise suggested by Doctor Pekol performed a most vicious violation of coding best practice, and was soon reprimanded. The man spoke little of the event when we interviewed him a few years back, clearly the trauma goes very deep, but it was not hard to piece out what happened. In a span of a fews seconds after typing the code, the student’s poor fingers were all broken. Nothing but a shadow swept through room, as quick as lightning. Pekol was never seen in public again. Pekol was on the loose, on a mindless code fixing rampage.

            There were a number of Pekol attacks in the years following the doctor’s fall into madness. The media made a strong attempt to cover them up, to prevent mass international panic. With the number of Pekol attacks increasing each year and the government refusing to do anything about it, we were forced to do the only thing we could. The Pekol Prevention Project (PPP) was born, a union of the best in coding, self-defence, and conspiracy theorists to combat this threat. We currently have over 250 undercover operatives across the world, actively working to find Pekol, prevent Pekol, and if necessary, stop Pekol. But like any hazard, knowledge is survival. We’ve interviewed countless victims and investigated hundreds of attacks, to bring you the best most up to date survival tips and strategies on the Doctor Pekol phenomenon.

           The PPP is dedicated to ending the Pekol threat. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t following coding best practices! It's a really good thing to do, Pekol or no Pekol. Seriously though, you shouldn’t have your fingers broken if you don’t follow best practice sometimes. Hence, Pekol must be detained, or removed if he will not cooperate. Currently our EAPAE (Elite Anti Pekol Assault & Eradication) team has tracked Pekol to the Toronto area of Ontario Canada. We believe it will not be long before we close in on his position. These are specially trained soldiers, with the highest level of skill in medium to long range weapon tactics as well ASP.NET and C#; they will not fail.
